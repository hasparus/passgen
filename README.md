# passgen
Short ruby script to generate random words from all ".dic" files in current directory. You can use it to generate passwords highly random and long, yet easy to remember.

NOTICE.
Do not use it just with English dictionary. These passwords are not strong enough. You'll be better off with combining Hungarian and French.

**If you need a strong password, always use long string of random characters.**
